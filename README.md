# No-DSS
an alternative to the DataStoreService for Roblox
<p><b>you want to save data for players but you dont want to use the DSS for some reason ? this is for you</b></p>



<p>this repo is the server source code that you need to use No-DSS</p>

basically you need :
  - a server or whatever (to run the server and hosting the database)
  - and the script to put in your ServerScriptService of your game
<p>and thats all</p>
